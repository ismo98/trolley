# Trolley

**Run terminal apps anywhere.**

Trolley is a simple terminal emulator runtime, allowing you to distribute TUI
applications to non-technical users. Although mostly simple, two recent developments
make it is quite powerful:

1. Improvements in terminal functionality and performance 
2. Flourishing of easy to use, powerful TUI libraries

If you are building software that fits the textual interface style, you'll be able
to create perfoment, _cross-platform_ applications. Launching in under a second is typical.
Combined with TUI frameworks like OpenTUI, Bubbletea & Ratatui, it is extremely easy 
to create apps with a developer experience not much different than a webapp's.

## Giants and their shoulders

Trolley is built on top of [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/),
which powers most of everything the end user will see and do, and enables the
aforemenetioned functionality. Even the GUI wrappers are stripped down versions
of Ghostty's.

For packaging, [cargo-packager](https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/cargo-packager)
does most of the heavy lifting.

Trolley, then, is an ergonomic wrapper around those two.

## Quickstart

```
trolley init my-app
```

This scaffolds a `trolley.toml` manifest. Point it at your TUI binary:

```toml
[app]
identifier = "com.example.my-app"
display_name = "My App"
slug = "my-app"
version = "0.1.0"

[linux]
binaries = { x86_64 = "target/release/my-app" }

[gui]
initial_width = 800
initial_height = 600

[fonts]
families = [{ nerdfont = "JetBrainsMono" }]

[ghostty]
font-size = 14
```

Then run to see how it works:

```
trolley run
```

Or package to send to your end users:

```
trolley package
```

## How it works

Trolley bundles your TUI, assets, and config next to a terminal emulator runtime. It
instructs it to launch your exeutable.

Trolley's runtime is a thin native wrapper around
[libghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty), the core library of
the Ghostty terminal emulator. libghostty handles VT parsing, PTY management,
GPU rendering, font shaping, and input encoding. Trolley provides the native
window and kiosk behavior.

| Platform | Runtime language | Windowing | Renderer |
|----------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| macOS    | Swift (AppKit)   | NSWindow  | Metal    |
| Linux    | Zig (GLFW)       | GLFW      | OpenGL   |
| Windows  | Zig (Win32)      | GLFW      | OpenGL   |

### Development Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with flakes enabled (provides all build tools), or:
- Rust toolchain, Zig compiler, and platform dependencies (GLFW, X11 libs on Linux)

## Manifest

The manifest file `trolley.toml` has the following sections:

### `[app]` -- required

| Field          | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `identifier`   | Reverse-DNS identifier (e.g. `com.foo.bar`)|
| `display_name` | Human-readable application name            |
| `slug`         | Filesystem-safe name (lowercase, hyphens)  |
| `version`      | Version string                             |
| `icon`         | Path to icon file (optional)               |

### `[linux]`, `[macos]`, `[windows]` -- at least one required

```toml
[linux]
binaries = { x86_64 = "path/to/binary", aarch64 = "path/to/binary" }
```

### `[gui]` -- optional

`initial_width`, `initial_height`, `resizable`, `min_width`, `min_height`,
`max_width`, `max_height`.

### `[fonts]` -- optional

```toml
[fonts]
families = [
    { nerdfont = "Inconsolata" },      # auto-downloaded from Nerd Fonts
    { path = "fonts/Custom.ttf" },     # local font file
]
```

### `[environment]` -- optional

```toml
[environment]
env_file = ".env"
variables = { MY_VAR = "value" }
```

### `[ghostty]` -- optional

Pass-through configuration for the Ghostty terminal engine. Accepts any
Ghostty config key with a scalar value (string, integer, float, or boolean).
Note that configs meant for Ghostty's GUI will not take effect (obviously).

```toml
[ghostty]
font-size = 14
theme = "dracula"
```

## Package formats

| Platform | Default formats                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Linux    | AppImage, .deb, .rpm, pacman, .tar.gz |
| macOS    | .app, .dmg, .tar.gz                   |
| Windows  | NSIS installer                        |

Select specific formats with `--formats`:

```
trolley package --formats appimage,deb
```

## BUNDLING != SANDBOXING

Trolley simply runs your executable inside a terminal, and in that sense, provides no
extra security or sandbox guarantees.
